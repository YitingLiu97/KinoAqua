KinoAqua

**KinoAqua** is a custom post-processing effect for Unity HDRP that creates a
simple watercolor effect.

The shader implementation of the effect is heavily inspired by
[a Shadertoy effect] created by Florian Berger (flockaroo). It uses the same
approach but with slightly different variables.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2019.4 or later

Although KinoAqua is compatible with all the HDRP-supported systems, it's
pretty slow and unoptimized. Don't try to run it on mobiles.
